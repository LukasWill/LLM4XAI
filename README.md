| LLM-generated explanations can help smaller models produce high-quality justifications for their predictions                             | [Explanations from Large Language Models Make Small Reasoners Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06726) | 2022 Oct |
| A comparative evaluation was made to allow us to gauge how LLM-generated _post-hoc_ explanations (using prompting) stand relative to state-of-the-art explainers like LIME, SHAP and Integrated Gradients for predictive models trained in tabular datasets | [Are Large Language Models Post Hoc Explainers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05797) | 2023 Oct |
